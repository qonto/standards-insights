# GitHub project

This provider discovers projects by reading GitHub repositories matching given topics.

Example:

```yaml
providers:
  github:
    url: "https://api.github.com/"
    topics:
      - standard-insights
    organizations:
      - foobar
    base-path: /repositories
```

You should also set the following variables to authenticate against GitHub:

- `GITHUB_APP_ID`
- `GITHUB_INSTALLATION_ID`
- `GITHUB_PRIVATE_KEY`

In this example, Standards Insights will fetch GitHub repositories from GitHubâ€™s API available at `https://api.github.com/`. Those repositories will be filtered by the organization `foobar`, and the topic `standards-insights`. Standards Insights will clone them on the `base-path` directory.
